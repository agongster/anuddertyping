--ANUDDER TYPUNG GAME--
by April Gong

Anudder Typing Game is a typing game in which the player must save their cows from 
udder annihilation by typing in the correct word before toxic hazards strike! Bombs,
poison, and hay will fall from the sky with randomized words attached to each falling object.

If bombs are not typed, a cow dies. If poison is not typed, a cow becomes sick, or 
a sick cow dies. If hay is typed, a new cow is spawned.

The player loses when there are no cows left, or if the cows get eaten by a wolf during
the boss level. The boss level will generate all of the player's missed words from
previous levels.

--INSTRUCTIONS--
To run the project, run gameScreen.py. Ensure that words.txt, the images folder,
and the sounds folder are all attached in the same folder as the term project
coding files. 

Other than CMU graphics, the Python's pillow module should be installed to generate images.

--SHORTCUTS--

tab: jump straight to the boss level. Note that if there have been no missed words,
the game is automatically won.

any non-zero digit: jump to that level.

0: pause the game.
